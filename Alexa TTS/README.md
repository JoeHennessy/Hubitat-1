Have you ever wanted to be able to issue Text to Speech (TTS) calls to your individual Amazon Echo, Dot, Spot, or Show devices from your Hubitat Elevation Hub?  If yes, read on!  If not, why wouldn't you want to do this?  Read on!

First things first...  Credit where credit is due...  Thank you to the authors of the folowing shell scripts, whose work was the basis for this integration.

Also, much thanks to Hubitat's Chuck Schwer, for his tips, tricks, nudging, and advice!


I have created a Hubitat App (Alexa TTS Manager) and Driver (Child Alexa TTS) which implement basic TTS capability directly on the Hubitat Elevation hub, with no need for another computer or hub.  The "Alexa TTS Manager" app communicates directly to the alexa.amazon.com website to list your devices.  You then select which devices you want to be able to issue TTS commands to.  The app then creates a "Child Alexa TTS" device for each selected Amazon device.  These child devices can be used by any Hubitat App that can utilize the "Speech Synthesis" Capability. 

Now, the tricky part...  (there's always a 'gotcha', right?)

In order for your Hubitat hub to communicate to https://alexa.amazon.com, it needs to be authenticated.  Unfortunately, Amazon has not yet seen fit to issue OAUTH keys for this type of integration, nor can you easily sign into your Amazon account from within the Hubitat Elevation Hub's Web App.  The solution comes in the form of a cookie.  You will have to obtain the contents of your browser's cookie after you sign into alexa.amazon.com, then strip out a bunch of fluff, and format it corectly so that it can be used by the "Alexa TTS Manager" app.  

My main browser of choice on Windows is Chrome.  Since I want this cookie to remain valid for a very long time, I decided that it was safest to download FireFox and install the "Cookies.txt" extension.  This way, I won't accidentally invalidate my cookie for alexa.amazon.com.  The goal is to be able to keep this cookie valid for a very long time.  There may be better solutions for this that I am not aware of, so please feel free to provide some feedback!  Always looking for some help!

Original method (see below for alternate, considered easier by most)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Fire up a browser, like FireFox, and install the Cookies.txt Extension by lennonhill (source available at https://github.com/lennonhill/cookies-txt)
2) Sign into https://alexa.amazon.com using your browser
3) Click on the 'Cookies.txt' extension and save the resulting cookie file to you computer
4) Open the cookie file in an editor like NotePad++
5) You should see something that looks similar to the following example

```

Every cookie that ends in ".amazon.com" but does not start with "www." or "alexa." needs to be used in the following step.  

Ignore the www.amazon.com and alexa.amazon.com lines. The rest need to be combined into a semicolon separated list, with all double quotes removed!  

The above cookie file would end up looking like the following string. Note, it seems like the order of these values might make a difference.  Try to replicate the order of each cookie value as shown below.  Your cookies.txt file may have more or less lines than mine did.  Using FireFox definitely produce fewer lines than Chrome for me!  If you have more or less, just roll with it and create your string that resembles the following.  Again, we're focusing only on lines that end in ".amazon.com" but do not start with "www." or "alexa."

Note:  Be sure to replace the spaces with equals signs and end section with a semicolon.  For example, "csrf 123456789" becomes "csrf=123456789;"

Alternate method to get the cookie directly from Chrome.  (Thanks @krlaframboise and @ritchierich !)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Open Chrome and Login to alexa.amazon.com
2) Open the Chrome menu at the top-right of your browser window, then select Tools (More Tools) > Developer Tools (or click F12)
3) On top row of developer tools you will see several tabs: Elements, Console, Sources, Network, etc. Click Network.
4) Just below the tabs you will see a red circle, below that you will see a filter box, and below that you will see sub tabs: All, XHR, JS, etc. Click XHR
5) Click Smart Home in the left navigation
6) The developer tools XHR list should populate with several items, one called "featureaccess-v3", right-click on it and choose Copy, Copy Request Headers. This will place it into your clipboard.
7) Open your favorite text editor such as Notepad and paste the contents into it.
8) The last item should be the cookie. Remove everything including "Cookie: ", leaving the raw cookie in the text editor.
9) Remove all double quotes. Search for double quotes and replace with an empty string.
10) Paste the cookie into the app and add a semi-colon to the end of it

Another way to get the cookie from Firefox without doing all the edits or needing the cookies extension (Thanks @NoWon)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) In FireFox goto to https://alexa.amazon.com/ then right click on the web page
2) select "inspect element (Q)"
3) select network and then XHR
4) right click on the "post" that has "alexa.amazon.com" and select "copy request headers"
5) then paste that into a notepad and your cookie will be clearly labeled there.
6) ignore the first "Cookie: " part and just add a semi-colon to the end

If someone wants to write a standalone app to parse the cookies.txt file and create the above semicolon delimited string, that would be a great help to users.

Okay, so you've got your cookie string.  Congratulations as I know that was a bit of manual work!  Now for the easy part!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Add the "Alexa TTS Manager" source code to your Hubitat 'Apps Code" as a new app and save it. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ogiewon/Hubitat/master/Alexa%20TTS/Apps/alexa-tts-manager.src/alexa-tts-manager.groovy
2) Add the "Child Alexa TTS" source code to your Hubitat 'Drivers Code" as a new app and save it. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ogiewon/Hubitat/master/Alexa%20TTS/Drivers/child-alexa-tts.src/child-alexa-tts.groovy
3) Go to your 'Apps', and click 'Load New App' and select the "Alexa TTS Manager"
4) Now copy and paste that huge cookie string you created earlier and paste it into the text box.  
5) Select your country from the drop down list.
6) Optionally, rename the App as you see fit.
7) Click Next.
8) If everything went well with your cookie, you should be able to select one or more of your Alexa devices on the page that comes up.
9) Click Done and you should be ready to give it a try!
10) Go to your 'Devices', and select the 'AlexaTTS yourdevicename' device from the list.  
11) On the device's detail page, type in any string your want and click 'Speak'
12) Optionally, change the Label of the device to whatever you'd like.  Do NOT change the Device Network ID!

If everything went well, you should be up and running!

Remember, this will only continue to work as long as the cookie from your browser session is valid.  Also, Amazon could change things behind the scenes at any time which could break this integration.  Enjoy it while it lasts!
